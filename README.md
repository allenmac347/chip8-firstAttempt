# chip8-firstAttempt
My first project on learning the basics of emulation.
Great resources that I used for reference while writing this project and recommend checking out is "Mastering Chip 8" by Matthew Mikolay (http://mattmik.com/files/chip8/mastering/chip8.html), Laurence Muller's awesome starter guide in writing a Chip8 emulator in C++ (http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/), and Wikipedia's article on Chip8 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8#Virtual_machine_description).
